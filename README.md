Server for beetlefinder alert service.

## Requirements

* Go 1.10 (but 1.6+ should be ok)
* PostgreSQL 10 (but 9+ should be ok)

## Installation

> `%GOPATH%` for Windows and `$GOPATH` for Unix-style OS (Linux, Mac).
>
> For developers it's recommended to create PostgreSQL user with login `postgres` and password `postgres` and make it able on `localhost:5432`. Or every time use `make recreate` with `CONN_STR=postgres://custom:12345678@localhost:5432`. Be sure path to <PostgreSQL_install_folder>/bin in your PATH variable. For example for Windows users: `C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\10\bin`.
>
> Before installing be sure you set up Go variables:
>
> * GOPATH and GOROOT system variables
> * GOPATH, GOROOT and GOPATH/bin in PATH

```sh
go get github.com/beetlefinder/go-server
cd %GOPATH%/src/github.com/beetlefinder/go-server
make get
make recreate
```

`make` command depends on `make get` (one time at installation only), so don't skip `make get` command.

## Build

```sh
make
```

Or with parameters:

```sh
make GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64
```

where `GOOS` and `GOARCH` is a Golang variables. By default it equals your system configuration.

## Run

Daemon run with hot loading sources (you don't need to rebuild app after source changing):

```sh
make run
```

## Create or Recreate Dev DB

```sh
make recreate
```

Or with parameters:

```sh
make recreate CONN_STR=postgres://custom:12345678@localhost:5432
```

Parameters by default:

* CONN_STR=postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432

## Contributing

### Source Checking

Before every commit run:

```sh
make
make format
make test
```

If you see some info after `make` or `make format` then something WRONG with sources. **Don't commit while understand what's happened and fix it.**

You can run one command instead:

```sh
make; make format; make test
```

### Line Ending

**Check line ending before add new file - it must be `LF`.**

Set up git to translate CRLF to LF:

```sh
git config core.autocrlf input
```

or to global config if it's ok for you:

```sh
git config --global core.autocrlf input
```

### Commit Message

In every commit message specify GitHub issue number using `#` if enable:

```text
#42 Answered to The Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything
```
